This took me some finagaling to get working properly so I thought I would post it in case anyone else was having issues with the syntax.  By default `ng-class` checks for truthy values, but you can use a ternary operator if you want like this:

{% highlight html %}
<i class="fa" ng-class="issue.data.user.login === comment.user.login ? 'fa-user' : 'fa-comment' "></i>
{% endhighlight %}

It's important to note you don't have to put all of your classes in ng-class.  If your element has multiple classes you can stick the other ones inside of the normal clss tag.
