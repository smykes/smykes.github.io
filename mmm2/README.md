###Features###
* Pick from one to four clefs including all of your personal favorites: **treble**, **bass**, **alto**, and even the dreaded **tenor**.
* Up to **60 questions per** worksheet.
* Chose if you want a question slot to have no note, or a particular clef.
* Chose from any combination of **key signatures**.
* Worksheet didn't turn out the way you wanted?  Easily go back and edit it and try again!
* Easily print just what you need, no extraneous images or site interface will print on a worksheet.

This software has no connection with http://www.madminutemusic.com, however; it's probably debatable who has been using the name longer.  Please do not claim this idea or code to be yours, if you do end up hosting this somewhere (I would prefer you use my hosted version) credit me please.  You should also probably rip out a lot of the extraneous stuff, like the about, and bugs and issues pages.
